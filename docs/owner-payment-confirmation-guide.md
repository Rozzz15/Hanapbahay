# Owner Payment Confirmation Guide

## Where to Confirm Payments

As an owner, you can confirm tenant payments in the **Owner Dashboard**.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Log in to your owner account**
   - After logging in, you should be automatically redirected to the Owner Dashboard
   - If not, navigate to the Dashboard tab (first icon in the bottom navigation)

2. **Find the "Revenue & Payments" Section**
   - Scroll down on the Owner Dashboard
   - Look for the **"Revenue & Payments"** section with a cash icon (💰)
   - This section shows all your approved bookings

3. **Expand the Section**
   - Tap on the "Revenue & Payments" header to expand it
   - You'll see a list of all approved bookings with their payment status

4. **Look for Pending Confirmations**
   - Bookings with payments awaiting your confirmation will show a **yellow alert box**
   - The alert box will display:
     - "Payment Awaiting Confirmation (X)" - where X is the number of pending payments
     - Payment amount
     - Payment method (e.g., "PayMongo GCash")
     - Payment date

5. **Confirm or Reject Payment**
   - Each pending payment will have two buttons:
     - **"Confirm"** (green button) - Click this if you've verified the payment in your account
     - **"Reject"** (red button) - Click this if you did NOT receive the payment
   
6. **After Confirmation**
   - When you confirm, the payment status changes to "Paid"
   - The tenant receives a notification that their payment was confirmed
   - The payment is added to your revenue

7. **After Rejection**
   - When you reject, the payment status goes back to "Pending"
   - The tenant receives a notification that the payment was not received
   - They can try making the payment again

## Important Notes

- **PayMongo Payments**: When tenants pay via PayMongo GCash, payments are automatically verified by PayMongo but require your confirmation to ensure you received the money in your account
- **Payment Account Link**: Payments are linked to your GCash payment account (the one you set up in Payment Settings)
- **Notifications**: You'll also receive a message notification when a payment is waiting for confirmation
- **Multiple Payments**: If a tenant has multiple pending payments, they'll all be listed in the confirmation section

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see the "Revenue & Payments" section**
- Make sure you have at least one approved booking
- Try refreshing the dashboard by pulling down

**Q: I don't see any pending confirmations**
- All payments may have already been confirmed
- Check if there are any new tenant payments via PayMongo

**Q: The confirmation buttons don't work**
- Make sure you have an active internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Contact support if the issue persists
